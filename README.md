### Topics reportedly covered:
Basics of the Linux operating system
### Booting and it's types:
Booting is the process of starting or restarting a computer. In Linux, the booting process involves several stages that load the operating system and prepare the system for use.
**Types of booting:**
1. Cold Boot (Hard Boot)
Occurs when the computer is started from power off.

Complete hardware and software initialization.

Performed when the system is completely shut down and powered back on.

2. Warm Boot (Soft Boot)
Restarting the system without turning off the power.

Done by the reboot or shutdown command.

Faster than cold boot as it skips some hardware checks.
### Updates:

**Oracle VirtualBox –** For running virtual machines

**Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable –** Required for some system components
