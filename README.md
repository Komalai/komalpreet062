# Day - 1
**Date:** 25th June 2025

### Status:
I was absent today due to personal reasons.

### What I Missed:
The first session of Semester 3, which included an introductory training on Linux.

### Topics reportedly covered:
Basics of the Linux operating system
### Booting and it's types:
Booting is the process of starting or restarting a computer. In Linux, the booting process involves several stages that load the operating system and prepare the system for use.

**Types of booting:**
1. Cold Boot (Hard Boot)
Occurs when the computer is started from power off.

Complete hardware and software initialization.

Performed when the system is completely shut down and powered back on.

2. Warm Boot (Soft Boot)
Restarting the system without turning off the power.

Done by the reboot or shutdown command.

Faster than cold boot as it skips some hardware checks.
### Updates:

We are required to download and set up the following software for upcoming practicals:

**Oracle VirtualBox –** For running virtual machines

**Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable –** Required for some system components

**Ubuntu 24.04.2 ISO –** To install and use Linux in a virtual environment
### Next Steps:

Download and install the above softwar
# Day-2
**Date:** 26th June 2025

Our professor tells us that after we finish our work, we should help our classmates. She says helping others is not only good for them, but also helps us learn better. When we explain something to a friend, we understand it more too.

# Introduction to linux:
### Kernel:
A kernel is the core component of an operating system. It is responsible for managing system resources and it acts as a bridge between hardware and software.

### Shell:
A shell is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system kernel. It allows users to interact with the computer by typing commands.
Analogy: Chef & Waiter in a Restaurant
**Characters:**
 Chef → Kernel

 Waiter → Shell

 Customer → User
 
The shell is like a waiter who takes your order (command), and the kernel is like the chef who prepares the dish (executes the command). You never talk to the chef directly.To communicate with the chef we can communicate through the waiter only.

**Types of shell:**

1. Bash(Bourne Again Shell) - Most common and default shell
  
2. Sh (Bourne Shell) - Original shell
  
3. Zsh - Powerful and customizable.
  
4. Fish - Friendly interactive shell


**Further shell is divided ito two types:**

1. Command Line Shell:
  A command-line shell is a text-based interface where you type commands to tell the computer what to do, using a keyboard.

2. Graphical Shell:
A graphical shell is a user interface that lets you interact with the computer using pictures, icons, and menus, usually with a mouse.
